# CharacterTalentTree :sword:
A program I created for a multiplayer mod for users to create character builds using various talent trees.

# Features :star:
- Written in C# utilizing Window forms
- Progression based talent tree that requires previous traits to unlock certain late-tier traits
- Errors that indicate wrong selections or too few amount of points to spend
- Popup box when hovering over a trait that tells you what that trait does
- Choose between three expansion trees using a checklist
